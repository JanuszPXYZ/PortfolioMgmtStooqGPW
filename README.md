# PortfolioMgmtStooqGPW

Inspired by the fantastic book that is "Machine Learning & Data Science Blueprints for Finance" written by Hariom Tatsat, Sahil Puri, and Brad Lookabaugh, I decided to perform a similar analysis to the one in Chapter 7.
The difference was the data that I used to achieve the results of the "portfolio management". Where authors used the DJIA data, I decided to look at the Polish
Stock Exchange (GPW) and its biggest index (WIG20). I gathered the data from Stooq, using the simple library that I constructed for that purpose (StooqDownloadPrepare.py).


# ToDo
- Create a separate script for the functions used within the Jupyter Lab notebook(s).
